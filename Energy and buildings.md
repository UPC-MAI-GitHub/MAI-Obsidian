We systematically investigate the association strength of each input variable with each ofthe output variables using a variety of classical and non-parametric statistical analysis tools, in order toidentify the most strongly related input variables. Then, we compare a classical linear regression approachagainst a powerful state of the art nonlinear non-parametric method, random forests, to estimate HL andCL. Extensive simulations on 768 diverse residential buildings show that we can predict HL and CL withlow mean absolute error deviations from the ground truth which is established using Ecotect (0.51 and1.42, respectively).
