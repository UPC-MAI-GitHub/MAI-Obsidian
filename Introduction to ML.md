### Introduction

	- Algorithms
	- Data
	- Statistical
	- Learning
	- Graphs
	- Clustering
	- Machine
	- Complex
- Why to study ML?
	- Reduce human effort on complex or expensive tasks (*knowledge engineering bottleneck*)
	- Automatize processes and adapt them to multiple cases (*personalization*)
	- Discover new knowledge from large databases (*data mining*)
- A lot of data is exploited from social media users
- Already we have
	- Efficient algorithms
	- Large amounts of on-line data
	- Powerful computational resources
- *Arthur Samuel (1959)* ML allows computers to learn without explicit programmed instructions.
### Definitions
- *Webster* **(Learn)**: gain knowledge, understand, gain skill --by--> study, receive instruction, experience
	- Learn *facts*
	- Learn *how*
	- *Improve* something previously *learned*
- *Helbert Simon* **(Learning)**: system improve performance from experience.
- *Tom Mitchell*: Study **algorithms** that, at some **task T**, improve their **performace P** based on **experience E**.
	- Well defined learning-task <T,P,E>
- *Desingning a Learning System:*
	- Choose the training experience
	- Choose the target function (What is to be learned?)
	- Target function representation
	  Choose the learning algorithm
### Concepts
- **Task**
	- Classification (defined finite set of categories)
	- Regression (open range to predict)
	- Problem solving / planning / control (little bit complex tasks divided to provide step by step solutions)
- **Evaluate performance**
	- According to the nature of the task
		- Classification accuracy
		- Solution correctness
		- Solution quality
		- Speed of performance
- **Model representation**
	- Neuron, trees, case based, etc.
