## Notes
### What is supervised learning?
* Inferring a *function* from *labeled training data*
* $D(x,y) \rightarrow f(x_i)\rightarrow y_i$
* where $x$ is the input and $y$ is the output
* ![[A Gentle Introduction to Supervised Machine Learning 2023-11-07 10.13.36.excalidraw]]
* **When to use ML**
	* There is a *pattern*
	* We *cannot* pin it down *mathematically*
	* We have **data** on it
* **Tasks of Machine learning** 
	* *Prediction*: medical diagnosis, spam mail $\longrightarrow$ *Supervised Learning*
		* *Regression* $\longrightarrow$ numerical data (continuous variable), real-value output
		* *Classification* $\longrightarrow$ discrete, nominal, categorical data
	* *Understanding*: market basks, discovering astronomical features $\longrightarrow$ *Unsupervised Learning*
	* *Control*: flying helicopters $\longrightarrow$ *Reinforcement Learning*
* **Generalization**
	* A model that *performs the best on future examples*
	* We hope that *future data* will remember *past data* in a way that while let us use the past data to construct a model that will perform well in the future
* **What ML algorithm to choose?**
	* What do you want to predict?
	* What kind of data can you get?
	* What is the relative costs of different types of errors? 
	* How does the available data relate to future data?
* **Common Jargon**
	* *Rows*: features /attributes / dimensions
	* *Columns*: instances / examples / samples
	* *To be predicted* target/ outcome / response / label / dependent variable
	* *Other features*: independent variables / covariates / predictors / regressors
* **Different types of data**
	* *iid* (independent identically distributed) vectors
	* *Time series* (dependent vectors)
	* *Images* (matrices)
	* *Variable-size non-vector data* (strings, trees, graphs)
	* *Objects* (within a relational schema)
### An introductory example: Linear Regression Model
* **In supervised learning**:
	* A model that *maps input* data *to the output* label
	* *Infinite number of models* (lines) can be defined $\rightarrow$ *Hypothesis set*
		* e.g. $H(w_0,w_1)\equiv w_1x+w_0$
	* The learning process  for selecting the most appropriate parameters
	* ![[Pasted image 20240107122745.png|350]]
	* *Elements of supervised learning*
		* *Data* $\rightarrow$ $x,y$ (input and target output)
		* *Model* $\rightarrow$ Hypothesis set (possible/candidate models), Learning algorithm
		* *Prediction* $\rightarrow$  Selected model ($f \in H$) / Model outputs 
	* *Linear regression* Find a model defined by the parameters $w_0,w_1$ so that the prediction $f(x_i;w_0,w_1)$ *is as close as possible to* $y_i$, so we try to minimize the distance between them, and that is called *the learning process* $$minimize \frac{1}{N}\sum\limits_{i=1}^{N}(f(x_i;w_0,w_{1)}-y_i)^2$$
	* This function of minimization is often called the *cost function / loss function / error measure*
	* We end up with:
		* *Hypothesis*: $f(x,w) = w_1x+w_o$
		* *Parameters*: $w = (w_o,w_1)^T$ 
		* *Cost function*: $J(w_0,w_1)=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}(f(x_i;w_0,w_1)-y_i)^{2}$
		* *Goal*:    $minimize\;\; J(w_0,w_1)$
### Travelling across the Parameter Space
* **Parameter space**
	* Descent optimization methods
	* The parameters space is a representation that help us to track the progress of our algorithm performance. According to the accuracy and cost function of our model we can track if the parameters are good enough.
	* The idea is to get the parameters convergence when the model represents the data in the best possible way.
	* ![[Pasted image 20231107112817.png]]
	* *How to find the minimum in an automated way?*
		* Start with some starting point (guess)
		* Update the parameters iteratively so that we reduce the cost function (repeat this step iteratively)
		* Stop when the cost function is not reduced anymore
		* The cost function space can be represented as surface where the goal is to reach the global minima
		* ![[Pasted image 20231107113148.png]]
		* *Descent methods*
			* Determine the route to get the global minima by descending in the cost function surface by updating the parameters
			* Given a statring point $x \in dom\; f$
			* *While* the *criterion* is not *satisfied*
				* Determine a *descent direction* $\Delta x = -\nabla f(x)$
				* Chose a *step size* $t>0$
				* *Update * $x := x + t \Delta x;$
			* ![[Pasted image 20231107113534.png]]
			* ![[Pasted image 20231107113549.png]]
			* ![[Pasted image 20231107113642.png]]
			* ![[Pasted image 20231107113717.png]]
			* ![[Pasted image 20231107113754.png]]
			* The *gradient* of a function is the multi-variate extension of the derivative for a single variable 
			* Observe that the *optimum* is located in the other half space 
			* Note that *not all direction on that space are descent directions*
			* Observe that we can find a direction with higher value pointing to any point between the green and orange level sets 
			* Observe that the direction with steepest *descent* is precisely $\Delta x = -\nabla f(x)$ 
			* *Gradient descent* is an algorithm to *minimize any function or parameter*
			* **Learning rate** (Gradient steepest descent)
				* If *t* is too *small*, *gradient descent* will be *slow* 
				* If *t* is too *large*, *gradient descent* can *overshoot the minimum*. It may *fail to converge* or even *diverge* 
					* ![[A Gentle Introduction to Supervised Machine Learning 2023-11-07 11.43.59.excalidraw]]
				* There is *no need to decrease $t$ over time* 
				* Gradient descent can converge even if $t$ is fixed
### Application of the Learning Model
* We train a model with our training data, hoping it will perform well with new data.
* *Evaluation strategy*
	* Divide the *training data* in two
		* *Train set* $\rightarrow$ learn the model
		* *Test set* $\rightarrow$ compute the performance of the method
	* We can still divide the *Train data* in two
		* *Train set* $\rightarrow$ learn the models
		* *Validation set* $\rightarrow$ decide which of the models adapts better to the problem
