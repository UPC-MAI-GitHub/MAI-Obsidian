## Notes
### Main trends ins Computer Science
- **Ubiquity**: reduction in size and cost of computing capability (omnipresence)
- **Ambient Intelligence**: increase of the knowledge domain and inference capabilities to provide better user experiences.
- **Interconnection**: Computer systems are networked into large distributed systems (Internet) (Grid computing) (Peer-to-Peer computing)
- **Intelligence:** more intelligent problem solving techniques as the complexity of the tasks we automate also increases
- **Delegation**: computers doing more for us without our intervention. (*Giving control* to computers)
- **Human-orientation in programming methodologies**: Implement concepts and metaphors to reflect the way we understand the world.
- Programming progress

- **Goal?** --> a intelligent computer system that can *act on our behalf*
	- *Independently*
	- In a way that *represents our* best *interests*
	- Interconnection and distribution to *cooperate*, *reach agreements* or *compete* (compete with other systems)
### Agent and Multi-agent systems
- **Agent**
	- *Computer system* able to *interact independently* in a *dynamic environment*.
	- *Proactivity* from the *agent*
	- Assumed to be *autonomous*, *synchronize* and *coordinate* their activities at run time.
	- **Agent technologies**
		- *Agent-level*: refer to the individuals (reasoning and learning)
		- *Interaction-level*: communication between agents (languages, protocols, allocation mechanisms)
		- *Organization-level*: agent societies (structure, trust, norms, obligations, etc.)
	- Systems *taking the initiative* when necessary, *cooperating* to solve problems
	- Agents *cooperating to solve a task*
	- Take into account *social aspects*, these are important part of *intelligent activity in real-world*-settings.
	- **Agents vs Objects**
		- *Object*
			- Encapsulates some state, 
			- Communicates via message passing 
			- Has methods (operations to be performed on a given state)
			- Pasive/reactive -> *A method is always executed when called*.
		- *Expert systems*
			- Disembodied expertise (not practical, mostly abstract)
			- Typically work alone
			- Not aware of the environment (just ask info to the user)
			- Don't perform actions
			- Some expert systems can be *agentified*
		- *Agent*
			- Notion of autonomy (*decides whether to act or not on request from another agent*)
			- Intelligent
			- Flexible (reactive, proactive, social)
			- Always Active (*Multi-threaded systems*)
			- They can get an economic profit
	- **Considerations**
		- Balance *reaction-deliberation*
		- *Learning* from an about other agents in the environment
		- Electing upon user *preferences*
		- Find ways to *negotiate* and *cooperate (coalitions)*
		- Agents are no expert systems, but sometimes somo expert systems are agntified.
		- *Interaction*: probably the mist important single characteristic of complex software
	- **Some uses**
		- Complex and dynamic real-world environments simulations
		- A tool to get some light in the understanding  on various kinds of social processes.
		- *Agent-oriented software engineering* allows to structure applications with autonomous components.
- **Multi-agent system**
	- *X number of agents interacting with each other*. usually, each has a different goal and motivation.
		- *Simple case* -> programmed by the same and collaborate to complete a task
		- *General case* -> act on behalf of users with different goals and motivations
	- *Succesful interation* ---> *Cooperate*, *Negotiate*, *Coordinate*
